Task:
Given raw data about world statistics come up with insights about your region.
Team 2 region Eastern Europe.

THE SLOW DEATH OF EASTERN EUROPE

Methodology

First, we cleaned up the raw data by filling in missing information about our region then did outlier detection for all chosen categories using box plots.

In cleaning the data, the following countries were removed from the data set: San Marino and Andorra. This was due to the following reasons:
•	The two countries were too small and therefore skewed our data 
•	They were not economically connected to our region
•	The two countries are not in Eastern Europe

We also removed the following data: Births attended by skilled health staff, Educational attainment among different age groups and Prevalence of underweight because other metrics provided in the data set better explained the given criterions.

Analysis 

1.	Population
The region has a total population of 125,921,885 with Poland being the most populated county (population of 37,974,826)
The female population in Eastern Europe is the largest with a population percentage of 51.15%, while the male population stands at 48.85%.

The dependancy ratio is 51%.
Depenancy ratio can be defined as the age population ratio of those not in the labor force of a country by depend on the working population.

2.	Income inequality
Income inequality is best measured by the gini index
